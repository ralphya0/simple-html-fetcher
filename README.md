simple-html-fetcher
===================
    simple-html-fetcher lays on htmlparser 2.1, which can be used to fetch and save html pages that user want 
  to store on disk. All you need to do is input the 'namespace' which defines the range of pages you want.
  
    I will continue to improve simple-html-fetcher because there are so many things to do before it 
  can be called a complete project.
